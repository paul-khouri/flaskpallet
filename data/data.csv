"The Idiot", "At about nine o'clock one morning, at the end of November, during a thaw, a train of the St Petersburg-Warsaw 
line was approaching St Petersburg at full steam. Such were the damp and the fog that it was a while before daylight broke; at ten yards to the right and the left of the track it was hard to make out anything at all from the windows of the carriage. The passengers included some returning from abroad; but the third-class compartments were the most crowded, with ordinary folk and those on business, who had not travelled far. Everyone, as is usually the case, was tired, with eyes heavy after the night, everyone was cold, every face was pale yellow, the colour of the fog."
"The Battle For Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939", "including a large derachment of the local Falange. Among the dignitaries on the stage sat Franco's wife, the Bishop of Salamanca who had issued the pastoral letter, General Millan Astray, the Founder of the Foreign Legion, and Miguel de Unamuno, the Basque philosopher who was the rector of the university. Unamuno had been exasperated by the Republic, so in the beginning he had supported the nationalist rising. But he could not ignore the slaughter in this city where the infamous Major Doval from the Asturian repression was in charge, nor the murder of his friends Casto Prieto, the mayor of Salamanca, Salvador Vila, the professor of Arabic and Hebrew at the University of Granada, and of Garcia Lorca.

Soon after the ceremony began, Professor Francisco Maldonado launched a violent attack against Catalan and Basque nationalism, which he described as the ‘cancer of the nation', which must be cured with the scalpel of fascism. At the back of the hall, somebody yelled the Legion battlecry of "¡ Viva la Muerte! (Long live Death!). General Millan Astray, who looked the very spectre of war with only one arm and one eye, stood up to shout the same cry. Falangists chanted their ¡Vivas!, arms raised in the fascist salute towards the portrait of General Franco hanging above where his wife sat.

The noise died as Unamuno stood up slowly. His quiet voice was an impressive contrast. 'All of you await my words. You know me and are aware that I am unable to remain silent. At times to be silent is to lie. For silence can be interpreted as acquiescence. I want to comment on the speech, to give it that name, of Professor Maldonado. Let us waive the personal affront implied in the sudden outburst of vituperation against the Basques and Catalans. I was myself, of course, born in Bilbao. The bishop, whether he likes it or not, is a Catalan from Barcelona. Just now I heard a necrophilous and senseless cry: "Long live Death!" And I, who have spent my life shaping paradoxes, must tell you as an expert authority that this outlandish paradox is repellent to me. General Millan Astray is a cripple. Let it be said without any undertone. He is a war invalid. So was Cervantes.

‘Unfortunately there are all too many cripples in Spain now. And soon there will be even more of them if God does not come to our aid. It pains me to think that General Millan Astray should dictate the pattern of mass psychology. A cripple who lacks the greatness of Cervantes is wont to seek ominous relief in causing mutilation around him. General Millan Astray would like to create Spain anew, a negative creation in his own image and likeness; for that reason he wishes to see Spain crippled as he unwittingly made clear.’

The general was unable to contain his almost inarticulate fury any longer. He could only scream ¡Muera la inteligencia!, Viva la Muerte! (Death to the intelligentsia! Long live Death!). The Falangists took up his cry and army officers took out their pistols. Apparently, the general's bodyguard even levelled his submachine-gun at Unamuno's head, but this did not deter Unamuno from crying defiance.

‘This is the temple of the intellect and I am its high priest. It is you who profane its sacred precincts. You will win, because you have more than enough brute force. But you will not convince. For to persuade you would need what you lack: reason and right in your struggle. I consider it futile to exhort you to think of Spain.’

He paused and his arms fell to his sides. He finished in a quiet resigned tone: I have done. It would seem that the presence of Franco's wife saved him from being lynched on the spot, though when her husband was informed of what had happened he apparently wanted Unamuno to be shot. This course was not followed because of the philosopher's international reputation and the reaction caused abroad by Lorca's murder. But Unamuno died some ten weeks later, broken-hearted and cursed as a 'red' and a traitor by those he had thought were his friends."
