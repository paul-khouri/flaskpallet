One of the goals of psychoanalysis was the taming of morality.
Not only anarchic impulse but also the moral sense had to submit to reason.
But the dictatorship of reason could never be complete.
If our impulses are at war with each other they are also at war with the demands of conscience, themselves often conflicting.
The strength of the ego is shown not in trying to harmonise these conflicts but in learning to live with them.
That is part of what it means to accept a personal fate. But, for Freud, fatalism had nothing to do with passivity.

In some ways Freud's view of human life resembles that of Arthur Schopenhauer,
the nineteenth-century German philosopher of pessimism.
Freud claimed not to have read Schopenhauer until late in life.
But he also acknowledged that Schopenhauer had anticipated the
fundamental insight of psychoanalysis, writing:
"Probably very few people can have realised the momentous significance for
life and science of the recognition of unconscious mental processes".
