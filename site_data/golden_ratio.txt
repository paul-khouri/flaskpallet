The Golden Ratio
First posted: 17/09/2021

The association of the Golden Ratio with the pentagon, fivefold symmetry, and the Platonic solids
is interesting in itself and, indeed was more than sufficient to ignite the curiosity of the ancient
Greeks. The Pythagorean fascination with the pentagon and the pentagram, coupled with Plato's
interest in the regular solids and his belief that the latter represented fundamental cosmic entities,
prompted generations of mathematicians to labor on the formulation of numerous theorems concerning phi.
Yet the Golden Ratio would not have reached the level of almost reverential status that it
eventually achieved were it not for some truly unique algebraic properties. In order to understand these properties,
we need first to find the precise value of phi.
